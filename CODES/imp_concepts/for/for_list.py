a = [3, 5, 7, 8, 975, 4, 3]

# here, i prints elements
# for_while i in a:  # read as for_while every element in list print the element
#     print(i)

# here i prints index of every element in the list
# for_while i in range(len(a)):  # read as for_while every number in range(len(a) = 7) ie range(7) print number
#     print(i)


# this difference was important to note for_while character_grid in practice projects
