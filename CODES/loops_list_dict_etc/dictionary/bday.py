# note:
# You can see if the entered name exists as a key in the
# dictionary with the in keyword, just as you did for lists.
# If the name is in the dictionary, you access the associated
# value using square brackets; if not, you can add it using
# the same square bracket syntax combined with the assignment
# operator


# Of course, all the data you enter in this program is
# forgotten when the program terminates. Youâ€™ll learn how to
# save data to files on the hard drive in Chapter 9.
