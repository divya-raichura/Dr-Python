"==" vs "is"
== : compares values
is : compares reference


suppose...
a = 10
b = 10

in this case

case 1 :

if both and b point to same 10 then
a -> 10
b ---^
a == b : true
a is b : true

case 2 :

if both a and b point to different 10 then
a -> 10
b -> 10
a == b : true
a is b : false

values from -6 to 256 are reserved in python
ie: values in this range will follow case 1



suppose
a = 10
b = 10
as it is in range -6 to 256... both points to same 10
now, if you change b to 5
b = 5
then value of a will not change
only b will change... b will point to new object, 5
this means integers are immutable in python
