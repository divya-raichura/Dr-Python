similar to list, but it is immutable
ie, values cannot be changed/modified

The tuple which is created without using parentheses is also known as tuple packing.

Creating a tuple with single element is slightly different. We will need to put comma after the element to declare the tuple.

tup1 = ("JavaTpoint")
print(type(tup1))
#Creating a tuple with single element
tup2 = ("JavaTpoint",)
print(type(tup2))
Output:

<class 'str'>
<class 'tuple'>
