- we cannot directly access any element of the set by the index

- Each element in the set must be unique, immutable, and the sets
remove the duplicate elements.

- Sets are mutable which means we can modify it after its creation

- It can contain any type of element such as integer, float, tuple etc
But mutable elements (list, dictionary, set) can't be a member of set

- Creating an empty set is a bit different because empty
curly {} braces are also used to create a dictionary as well.
So Python provides the set() method used without an argument to
create an empty set.

- add() method is used to add a single element whereas the
update() method is used to add multiple elements to the set.

- we can remove elements from set using discard() or remove()
  if the item does not exist in the set then
  discard() => set remains unchanged
  remove()  => throws error

- pop() is also a method to remove element
  Generally, the pop() method will always remove the last item but
  the set is unordered so, we can't determine which element will be
  popped from set.
  pop() method could not determine the last element of the set as set is unordered
