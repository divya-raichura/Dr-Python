e = dict([('hello', 'divya'), ('hi', 'elon')])
# dict requires at most one argument, hence we made tuples inside
# list so that they all together are a single argument
# also, inside tuples also we need to create only 2 elements
# gives error if we create more or less than 2 elements inside tuple

# keys of dictionary should be immutable

# sets:-
# It can contain any type of element such as integer, float,
# tuple etc. But mutable elements (list, dictionary, set) can't
# be a member of set


# following are for sets:
- discard() = if the item does not exist in the set then the set remain unchanged
- remove()  = if...then throws error
- add()     = can add one item
- update()  = multiple items

# frozenset() :-
# The frozen sets are the immutable form of the normal sets
# the items of the frozen set cannot be changed, and therefore it can be used
# as a key in the dictionary. If we pass the dictionary as the sequence inside
# the frozenset() method, it will take only the keys from the dictionary
# and returns a frozenset that contains the key of the dictionary as its elements.
