strongly - python
loosely  - c


if we perform some function on two variables then will it check the
type or not then it is strongly

eg, if we do..
a = 10
b = 'divya'
a + b --> gives error, we can concatenate string and int
if we run same in c or java it will pass
in java it will concatenate and result will be a string
